# Is-My-Website-Secure

Is My Website Secure is a Flask website that scans the ports of other websites in order to make sure the website does not have any unnecessary ports open.

After inputting the websites that the users wish to scan, the website will run Python programs to scan the ports of the websites and output the result on the website.

This website utilizes Nmap, a free and open source port scanner.

Nmap can be downloaded simply by running the following Bash command on Terminal: ```sudo apt-get install nmap```
